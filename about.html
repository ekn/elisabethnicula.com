			<!-- <h3>About My Work</h3>
			<p>As a woodcut printmaker, I work in an improvisational, modular manner by carving spare, suggestive blocks and printing them alone or in combination. Paintings and etchings are also part of my studio practice.</p>
			<p>On the couch, I make animated versions of my woodcuts to realize the kinetics implied by the imagery and marks. I enjoy the contrast between an analog medium and a digital one.</p>
			<p>Outer space and the natural world, mathematics and machinery, cities and people&mdash;sums and all their component parts&mdash;are continuing sources of interest. I want to evoke strong associations with simple ingredients.</p>
			<p>My work is highly susceptible to the habits and obsessions I've acquired as a graphic designer, and I try to counterbalance order and containment with loose, organic imagery that a viewer can interpret in many ways. Through careful arrangement of forms, color, and emptiness, I attempt to convey an impression of boundaries, opposing forces, and unexpected commonality.</p>
